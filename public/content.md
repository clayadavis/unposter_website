Instead of a poster session that requires tedious prep work and leads to
scripted presentation, the unposter session requires little prep and
facilitates spontaneous and free-flowing conversation. Setup resembles a poster
session, but instead of pre-made posters, presenters will use poster-size
whiteboards to create visual aids on-the-fly as needed, expressing themselves
visually.

*   The event will take place the evening of April 8, starting at 6pm in the 
    [IMU Solarium](https://www.google.com/maps/place/39%C2%B010%2704.5%22N+86%C2%B031%2727.8%22W/@39.1677602,-86.5242628,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0).

I strongly encourage Informatics PhD students to 
[sign
up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UEAPZQTquaGi3T1Jmvu19UC6lcOb7Fu5Dlfmxs12RrA/viewform)
to present. Outside of our tracks and cohorts, we rarely have a chance to hear
about each other's work.  With your participation in this event, we can all
learn more about the amazing diversity of interests represented in our
department.

No RSVP needed to attend, sign up to present by **April 2** so we can get you in
the printed program.
